Feel free to AMA (Ask me anything. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out [Nick's example](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2oxk19/nick_offerman_chanticleer_ready_for_another_ama).) Some sample questions to get you started:

- I have project X. I want to add this feature. How can I do it?
- I just interviewed 10 people. So excited to put it together! But I don't know what to use and I don't have much time before the deadline. What do I do now?
- Why am I using GitHub?
- Do you like ice cubes?

**Note:** If you already know markdown, format the text in your issues to your heart's content. Otherwise, you should learn it. Consult the `Markdown supported` document (you can find it on top of the text window,) which opens in a new tab, and learn how to say things like *I really want to emphasize this* or **I really want to bolden that**. If you structure your thoughts with markdown I'll get you a coffee or something. Seriously.

If you have a truly personal matter, leave me an email in the issue, and I'll get back to you by inviting you to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) room where we can chat one-on-one.
