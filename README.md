### Some sample questions to get you started

- I have project X. I want to add this feature. How can I do it?
- I just interviewed 10 people. So excited to put it together! But I don't know what to use and I don't have much time before the deadline. What do I do now?
- Why am I using GitHub?
- Do you like ice cubes?

### Be specific when it comes to coding questions

**Specificity is your friend** when you are trying to find out why a certain piece of code that doesn't work. But how would ask a question that would help you to solve the problem (a.k.a. debug)?

Here's [an excellent article](http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/how-to-ask-programming-questions) on how to ask programming-related questions, by _Sisi Wei_ from Propublica (with whom some of you might have take the fundemental interactive or the data scraping class.) Pay particular attention to how you frame your question. It shows that you've worked through your problem, rather than dumping the workload to another person, thus losing a premium learning opportunity for yourself:

> When asking your question, be specific. This means your post should include:

> - The tools you’re using, including version numbers and your operating system version.
> - What you’re trying to accomplish – what did you expect to happen if everything had worked?
> - The code you’re using (or just the relevant parts)
> - Any error messages you got
> - What you’ve tried already, and what happened

**Note:** If you already know markdown, format the text in your issues to your heart's content. Otherwise, you should learn it. Consult the `Markdown supported` document (you can find it on top of the text window,) which opens in a new tab, and learn how to say things like *I really want to emphasize this* or **I really want to bolden that**. If you structure your thoughts with markdown I'll get you a coffee or something. Seriously.

If you have a truly personal matter, leave me an email in the issue, and I'll get back to you by inviting you to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) room where we can chat one-on-one.
