### How to communicate with Jue when you have a question?

Congrats, you've made it to this URL.

Now, to post your question, click on the `Issues` on the right,  then click `New issue` to open one.

Feel free to AMA (Ask me anything.) If you already know markdown, format the text in your issues to your heart's content. Otherwise, consult the `Markdown supported` document (you can find it on top of the text window,) which opens in a new tab, and learn how to say things like *I really want to emphasize this* or **I really want to bolden that**.

Let's begin our communication that way. If you have a truly personal matter, leave me an email in the issue, and I'll get back to you by inviting you to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) room where we can chat one-on-one.
