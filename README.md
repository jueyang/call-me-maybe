### Some sample questions to get you started

- I have project X. I want to add this feature. How can I do it?
- I just interviewed 10 people. So excited to put it together! But I don't know what to use and I don't have much time before the deadline. What do I do now?
- Why am I using GitHub?
- Do you like ice cubes?

*Let's do this.*

### Be specific when it comes to coding questions

**Specificity is your friend** when you are trying to find out why a certain piece of code doesn't work. 

Here's [an excellent article](http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/how-to-ask-programming-questions) on how to ask programming-related questions, by _Sisi Wei_ from Propublica. Pay particular attention to how you frame your question. It shows that you've worked through your problem, rather than dumping the workload to another person, thus losing a premium learning opportunity for yourself:

> When asking your question, be specific. This means your post should include:

> - The tools you’re using, including version numbers and your operating system version.
> - What you’re trying to accomplish – what did you expect to happen if everything had worked?
> - The code you’re using (or just the relevant parts)
> - Any error messages you got
> - What you’ve tried already, and what happened

### Use markdown to format your text

If you already know markdown, format the text in your issues to your heart's content. Otherwise, **you should learn it.** Consult the [Markdown supported](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) document (which you can also find on top of the text window when you open a new issue.)

Learn to say things like *I really want to emphasize this*, **I really want to bolden that**, or lists:

- hello
- hi
- aloha

If you structure your thoughts with markdown (and/or including an image like the one above) I'll play a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic87SfqQAAM) for you when you come by. Pick the theme song of your choice, seriously.

### Personal matter?

If you have a truly personal matter, such as a discussion on the philosophy of life, leave me an email in the issue. I'll get back to you by inviting you to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) room where we can chat one-on-one.
