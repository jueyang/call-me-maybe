### Congrats! You've made it to this repository.

Now, to post your question, click on the `Issues` on the right,  then click `New issue` to open one.

Feel free to AMA (Ask me anything.) Some sample questions to get you started:

- I have project X. I want add this feature. How can I do it?
- I just interviewed 10 people. So excited to put it together! But I don't know what to use and I don't have much time before the deadline. What do I do now?
- Why am I using GitHub?
- Do you like ice cubes?

If you already know markdown, format the text in your issues to your heart's content. Otherwise, consult the `Markdown supported` document (you can find it on top of the text window,) which opens in a new tab, and learn how to say things like *I really want to emphasize this* or **I really want to bolden that**.

Let's begin our communication that way. If you have a truly personal matter, leave me an email in the issue, and I'll get back to you by inviting you to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) room where we can chat one-on-one.
